## 📘 Day 22 — Daily Report

### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Understand why routes must not live in `main.py`
* Learn the concept and responsibility of an API Layer
* Prepare the project structure for scalable routing
* Separate app creation from HTTP concerns

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

* Difference between **endpoint** (API contract) and **route** (server-side implementation)
* Why putting routes in `main.py` causes coupling, poor testability, and scaling issues
* The meaning of **including** routers (wiring, not copying or executing)
* API Layer is about structure and discipline, not immediate functionality
* Architectural decisions must be made *before* the project grows

---

### 📁 Project Structure (Current)

* `app/main.py` — app factory only (no routes)
* `app/settings.py` — centralized, type-safe configuration
* `app/logging.py` — logging setup
* `app/deps.py` — dependency definitions
* `app/api/`

  * `__init__.py`
  * `router.py` — central API router (no routes yet)
* `.env.example` — environment template
* `README.md` — project overview and decisions
* `requirements.txt` — dependencies

---

✅ Outcome:
The project is now structurally ready for a real API layer without premature routing or architectural debt.
