**Day 24 – Daily Report**

### Objectives

* Establish a clean and scalable structure for system-level API endpoints.
* Enforce proper separation of concerns between `main.py`, API routers, and infrastructure-related routes.
* Validate the API composition pattern before introducing versioned feature endpoints.

### What I Learned

* System endpoints (e.g. health checks) are infrastructure concerns and must not live in `main.py`.
* `main.py` should only act as an application factory and composition root, not a place for route definitions.
* `APIRouter` composition via `include_router` is the foundation for scalable API growth.
* Centralizing all route aggregation in a single API router prevents architectural drift as the project grows.
* Keeping even simple endpoints (like `/health`) in dedicated modules is a deliberate architectural decision, not overengineering.

### Project Structure (So Far)

* `app/main.py`

  * Application factory
  * Lifespan management
  * Logging bootstrap
  * Includes the central API router only
* `app/api/router.py`

  * Central router responsible for aggregating all API routers
* `app/api/health.py`

  * Dedicated system endpoint for health checks
* `app/logging.py`

  * Logging configuration and setup
* `app/settings.py`

  * Application configuration management
* `app/deps.py`

  * Dependency access layer

This day solidified the API layer skeleton and prepared the codebase for clean versioning and feature expansion in the next steps.
