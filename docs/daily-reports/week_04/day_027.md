**Day 27 – Daily Report**

**Goals**

* Enforce clear API boundaries between system endpoints and versioned business APIs.
* Normalize router naming and aggregation to match the reference architecture.
* Remove temporary/test endpoints that do not belong to production-facing APIs.
* Establish a correct foundation for upcoming schema-first API development.

**What I Learned**

* System endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`, `/info`) must live outside versioned APIs and serve infrastructure/operations, not product clients.
* Versioned APIs (`/v1/...`) are reserved strictly for business logic and future-breaking changes.
* Router naming should be consistent (`router` inside modules, aliases at aggregation points) to avoid ambiguity and human error.
* Endpoint aggregation belongs in a dedicated API router layer, not in `main.py`.
* Readiness checks can be implemented as honest stubs during early stages, clearly marked as non-production behavior.
* Removing “temporary” endpoints early prevents long-term architectural drift.

**Project Structure (Current State)**

* `app/main.py`

  * Application factory and lifecycle setup
  * Includes the root API router only
* `app/api/router.py`

  * Central API aggregator (`api_router`)
  * Includes system and versioned routers
* `app/api/health.py`

  * System endpoints: health, readiness (stub), info
* `app/api/v1/router.py`

  * Version boundary for business APIs (`/v1`)
  * Prepared for future resource routers (users, auth, etc.)

This setup leaves the project structurally ready for adding schemas and real business endpoints in the next phase.
