**Day 25 – Daily Report**

---

### Goals for Today

* Establish API versioning from the beginning.
* Keep system endpoints separate from versioned feature endpoints.
* Ensure routing structure supports future growth without breaking clients.
* Clarify correct use of dependency injection with proper type hinting.

---

### What I Learned

* API versioning (`/v1`) is a contract mechanism, not just a folder or prefix.
* Feature endpoints must live under a versioned router; system endpoints like `/health` should not.
* Adding versioning late leads to breaking changes or duplicated logic.
* `APIRouter` prefix stacking determines final paths (e.g. `/v1` + `/users` → `/v1/users`).
* Dependencies should expose their own return types; routes should not directly depend on configuration classes.
* Proper type hinting can be achieved via dependency return types without tight coupling.
