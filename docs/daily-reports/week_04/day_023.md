### Day 23 – Daily Report

#### Goals

* Move all HTTP routes out of `main.py` into a proper API layer
* Introduce `APIRouter` as the single entry point for HTTP behavior
* Ensure `main.py` acts only as an application assembler (app factory)
* Validate dependency injection usage inside routers

---

#### What I Learned

* `APIRouter` is not for styling code; it is the control point for API growth (grouping, versioning, scaling).
* Routes defined on `app` vs routes defined on a router behave the same externally, but have very different architectural implications.
* `main.py` must not contain route definitions; it should only:

  * configure the app
  * manage lifespan/logging
  * include routers
* System endpoints like `/health` and informational endpoints like `/info` are still API concerns and belong in routers, not in `main.py`.
* Type hints (`dict[str, str]`, `dict[str, object]`) improve clarity and should follow modern Python syntax.
* Imports are justified by necessity, not by how many times they are used.

#### Project Structure (Up to Today)

```text
app/
 ├─ main.py              # FastAPI app factory, lifespan, logging, include_router
 ├─ settings.py          # Application configuration
 ├─ deps.py              # Dependency providers (e.g. get_settings)
 ├─ logging.py           # Logging setup
 └─ api/
    ├─ router.py         # Central API router + current endpoints
    └─ __init__.py
```

* All routes (`/ping`, `/health`, `/info`) are defined in the API layer.
* `main.py` contains no HTTP route definitions.
* The project is ready for further router decomposition and versioning.
