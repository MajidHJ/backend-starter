**Day 26 – Daily Report**

### Goals

* Understand the difference between **health** and **readiness** endpoints.
* Design a proper **readiness endpoint** aligned with production practices.
* Keep operational endpoints consistent with the overall API architecture.
* Reinforce correct use of **HTTP status codes** for service state signaling.

### What I Learned

* **Health vs Readiness**:

  * `/health` indicates the application process is alive.
  * `/ready` indicates the application is ready to handle real traffic, considering dependencies.
* **API Contract mindset**:

  * Endpoint response structure (fields, meanings) must remain stable over time.
* **HTTP Status Codes**:

  * `200` for ready/healthy states.
  * `503` for service unavailable but process still running.
* **Readiness design principles**:

  * Readiness must be honest (no fake “ok” states).
  * It should be lightweight and safe for frequent checks.
* **Python detail**:

  * Generator expressions (used with `all()`) are intentional and efficient.
  * Return type hints should be avoided when a route can return multiple response types.
* **FastAPI practice**:

  * Prefer `response_model` over return type hints for complex or multi-state responses.

### Project Structure (Current)

* `main.py`

  * Application factory and router inclusion only (no routes).
* `app/api/router.py`

  * Central API router.
* `app/api/health.py`

  * `/health` endpoint.
  * `/ready` endpoint with structured readiness response.
* Clear separation between:

  * Application setup
  * API routing
  * Operational/infra endpoints
