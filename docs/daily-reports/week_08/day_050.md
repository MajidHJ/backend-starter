## Day 50 – Daily Report

### 🎯 Goals

* Understand the role of **Domain Errors** in a layered architecture
* Clarify the separation between **Domain logic** and **HTTP layer**
* Identify weaknesses in the current `None / False` error handling approach
* Define an initial **Error Vocabulary** for the Users module
* Prepare the mental model for implementing domain exceptions in upcoming days

---

## 📚 What I Learned

### 1. Domain Error vs HTTP Error

* A **Domain Error** represents a business rule violation (e.g., `UserNotFound`)
* An **HTTP Error** is just the protocol-level translation (e.g., 404)
* The domain layer must never depend on FastAPI or HTTP concepts
* Error translation should happen in the API layer (later via centralized handler)

---

### 2. Why `return None` / `False` Is Problematic

* `None` is ambiguous and hides the real reason for failure
* It forces route-level conditional logic (`if user is None`)
* It leads to inconsistent API behavior as the project grows
* Explicit exceptions are more expressive and maintainable

---

### 3. Error Vocabulary for Users Module

Defined expected domain-level errors:

* `UserNotFound`
* `EmailAlreadyExists`
* `InvalidUserData`
* `InvalidPagination` (if moved to domain level)

This prepares the system for structured exception handling in Week 8.

## 🏗 Project Structure (Up to Today)

```
app/
 ├── api/
 │    └── v1/
 │         └── users.py          # FastAPI routes (HTTP layer)
 │
 ├── application/
 │    └── users/
 │         └── service.py        # Use-case logic
 │
 ├── schemas/
 │    └── user.py                # Pydantic request/response models
 │
 ├── domain/                     # (Prepared for domain errors – next step)
 │
 ├── settings.py                 # Application configuration
 ├── dependencies.py             # Dependency injection
 └── main.py                     # App bootstrap
```

Architecture principles currently enforced:

* Clear separation of API layer and application logic
* Dependency Injection for services
* Pagination implemented
* No domain exceptions yet (planned next)

## Summary

Today focused on strengthening architectural thinking around error handling.
No code changes were made.
Prepared conceptual foundation for implementing domain exceptions and centralized error handling in upcoming days.
