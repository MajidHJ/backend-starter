## Day 33 – Daily Report

### Goals

* Standardize application error responses.
* Prepare the API for future centralized exception handling.
* Treat errors as part of the API contract, not ad-hoc responses.

### What I Learned

* An API must return **predictable error shapes** so clients can handle failures reliably.
* Validation errors (`422`) are framework-level (FastAPI/Pydantic) and must be separated from application/business errors.
* Application errors should follow a **single error response schema** (`error`, `message`).
* Error codes (e.g. `USER_NOT_FOUND`) are conventions that become **public contracts** once clients depend on them.
* RESTful design is resource-oriented; HTTP methods define behavior, URLs define resources.
* Stateless APIs require each request to be self-contained.

### Project Structure (Current)

* `app/main.py` – FastAPI app initialization.
* `app/api/router.py` – Central API router.
* `app/api/health.py` – Health endpoint.
* `app/api/v1/` – Versioned API layer.
* `app/api/v1/demo.py` – Demo endpoint using standardized error response.
* `app/schemas/common.py` – Shared schemas, including `ErrorResponse`.
* `app/schemas/` – Central place for API contracts (request/response models).
