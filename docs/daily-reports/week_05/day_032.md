**Daily Report — Day 32** 

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Understand request validation in FastAPI using Pydantic.
* Learn why HTTP **422 Unprocessable Entity** is a feature, not a bug.
* Enforce API contracts at the schema level instead of inside routes.
* Prepare the API for consistent error handling in upcoming days.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

* FastAPI validates request data **before** the route handler is executed.
* Pydantic schemas are not just data shapes; they actively **guard input quality**.
* Validation errors automatically result in **HTTP 422**, which clearly signals invalid client input.
* Request schemas and response schemas must remain **separate** to avoid data leakage.
* Writing manual validation (`if` checks) inside routes is an architectural mistake.
* Swagger (`/docs`) is the fastest and most reliable way to test validation behavior.
