### Day 31 Report

**Goals for Today**

* Understand the difference between **Request Schema** and **Response Schema**
* Prevent data leakage in API responses
* Learn to think in terms of **API contracts**, not raw dictionaries

---

**What I Learned**

* Request and response schemas must be **separate** and serve different purposes
* Data sent by the client is **not equal** to data stored or returned by the server
* Some fields belong **only to requests** (e.g. `password`)
* Some fields belong **only to responses** (e.g. `id`)
* Using one schema for everything leads to **over-posting**, **under-posting**, and security bugs
* `response_model` enforces the API contract and prevents leaking extra fields
* Validation happens **before** the route logic (422 is a feature, not a bug)
* This day is mostly **conceptual and mental training**, real usage comes in Users API

---

**Project Structure (Current)**

* `app/`

  * `main.py` — App factory, lifecycle setup
  * `api/`

    * `router.py` — Central API router
    * `health.py` — `/health` and `/ready`
    * `v1/`

      * `router.py` — API versioning (`/v1`)
  * `schemas/`

    * `common.py` — Shared schemas

      * `HealthResponse`
      * `ExampleRequest`
      * `ExampleResponse`
  * `deps.py` — Dependency definitions
  * `settings.py` — Pydantic settings (config)
* No database yet
* No real Users API yet
* API discipline and schema contracts are now enforced

---

**Summary**

* Today was about **locking the mental model** of request vs response
* No feature work, but a critical foundation for upcoming Users and Auth APIs
