**Day 30 – Daily Report**

### Objectives

* Move from implicit API responses to **explicit, contract-driven responses**
* Introduce **schema-first thinking** for API design
* Understand how FastAPI enforces API contracts at runtime
* Prepare the foundation for stable CRUD endpoints in upcoming days

---

### What I Learned

* The difference between **returning raw dicts** and using `response_model`
* Meaning and role of **Schema** as an explicit API contract (not a database model)
* How `response_model` performs **validation** and **serialization**
* Why **type hints alone are not enough** for HTTP contracts
* How schemas:

  * Prevent data leakage
  * Stabilize API responses
  * Protect frontend from unintended backend changes
* Why debug-only data (e.g. timestamps) must **not pollute stable contracts**
* The conceptual difference between:

  * Internal data / models
  * External API-facing schemas
* Why FastAPI uses the term **`response_model`** instead of `response_schema`

---

### Project Structure (Up to Today)

* `app/`

  * `api/`

    * Versioned routes (`v1`)
    * Health and readiness endpoints
  * `schemas/`

    * Centralized API contracts (response schemas)
    * Separation between API boundary and internal logic
  * Clear layering between:

    * HTTP layer (routes, status codes)
    * Contracts (schemas)
    * Future domain / service logic

---

### Outcome

* The API is no longer “best-effort”; it is **contract-driven**
* The project is structurally ready for:

  * Request/response separation
  * Secure user endpoints
  * Consistent error handling in the next steps
