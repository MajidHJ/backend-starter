**Day 29 – Learning Report**

### Objectives

* Establish clear HTTP semantics for infrastructure endpoints.
* Treat API endpoints as explicit contracts, not just working functions.
* Prepare the codebase for upcoming schema and error standardization.

### What I Learned

* HTTP status codes are part of the API contract, not an implementation detail.
* `status_code` in route decorators defines the default success semantics.
* `responses` is used only for OpenAPI documentation and must follow the OpenAPI schema (e.g. `description`, not arbitrary keys).
* Readiness endpoints must return meaningful status codes (e.g. `503` when not ready) to be correctly interpreted by load balancers and monitoring systems.
* FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI from code, but only if contracts are defined explicitly.
* The difference between runtime response content and documentation-level response definitions.
* How type hints for `responses: dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]]` map to OpenAPI concepts.

### Project Structure (as of today)

* `app/main.py` – application entry point
* `app/api/router.py` – central API router
* `app/api/health.py` – infrastructure endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`, `/info`)
* `app/deps.py` – dependency providers (e.g. settings)
* `app/settings.py` – application configuration

This day focused on locking down HTTP behavior at the API boundary to ensure future features build on a predictable and production-aligned contract.
