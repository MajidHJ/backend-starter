Below is your **Day 49 report**, strictly based on the Week 7 / Day 49 section and its surrounding context in the roadmap files.

According to a document from the project materials (Week 7 – Day 49 section), today is the **Architecture Lock-in & Review Day**.

# 📘 Day 49 — Review & Architecture Lock-in

## 🎯 Goals for Today

* Review the full Week 7 refactor
* Verify separation between route and application layer
* Ensure Command / Query pattern is correctly applied
* Confirm Dependency Injection is properly implemented
* Prepare a clean architectural commit
* Lock in the new mental model before moving to Week 8

---

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

* A route must act as **orchestration only** — no business logic inside it
* Application logic belongs to the **service layer**, not FastAPI endpoints
* Command = state mutation, Query = read-only operation
* Separating read and write simplifies reasoning, testing, and scaling
* Proper Dependency Injection prevents global state issues and improves testability
* Architecture is not “extra structure” — it determines future maintainability
* Refactoring is not about changing code — it is about correcting responsibility boundaries

From earlier days that led to this point:

* CRUD without separation leads to logic inside routes and global state problems
* Commands & Queries introduce a use-case driven structure
* DI removes hard-coded service creation and prepares for real infrastructure later
* Pagination and error schema were intentionally introduced earlier to support architectural maturity

## 🏗 Project Structure (Current)

Based on the refactor progression, the project now follows this layered structure:

```
app/
├── api/
│   ├── router.py
│   ├── health.py
│   └── v1/
│       ├── router.py
│       └── users.py
│
├── application/
│   └── users/
│       ├── service.py
│       ├── commands.py
│       └── queries.py
│
├── schemas/
│   ├── user.py
│   └── common.py
│
├── deps.py
├── settings.py
└── main.py
```

Architectural properties achieved:

* API layer separated from business logic
* Schemas defined independently from application logic
* Command / Query split inside application layer
* Dependency Injection centralized in `deps.py`
* CRUD operations are now testable and structured

---

## ✅ Position in the 6-Month Roadmap

After Week 7:

* The project now has a real architecture
* CRUD is structured and testable
* The system is ready for:

  * Repository layer
  * Database integration
  * Unit testing
  * Centralized error handling (Week 8)

---

This concludes Day 49.
