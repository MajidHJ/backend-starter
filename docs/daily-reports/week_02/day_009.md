## Day 9 – Daily Report

### Goals

* Introduce environment-based configuration into the project
* Separate runtime configuration from application code
* Prepare the codebase for a centralized, type-safe settings system
* Establish correct Git practices for environment files

---

### What I Learned

**Environment Variables & Configuration**

* Environment variables are runtime inputs provided by the execution environment, not by the code itself
* Application behavior should change via environment variables, not code changes
* Hardcoding configuration creates coupling between code and environment and leads to deployment issues

**`.env` vs `.env.example`**

* `.env` contains real, local values and must never be committed
* `.env.example` defines the configuration contract and must be committed
* Ignoring `.env.*` is incorrect when `.env.example` is part of the architecture
* `.env.example` enables reproducibility and clear onboarding

**python-dotenv**

* `python-dotenv` is a development convenience tool, not a production configuration system
* It loads values from `.env` into process environment variables
* The application should not depend on how env variables are provided

**Logging Best Practices**

* Logging with `%s` and `%r` is preferred over f-strings
* `%r` reveals raw values and types, which is critical when inspecting env inputs
* Logging supports lazy evaluation and cleaner separation of message vs data

**Architectural Discipline**

* Environment variables are introduced but not yet validated or typed (intentional)
* No defaults, parsing, or settings abstraction is added yet
* Configuration is read in a single place to enable clean refactoring later

### Project Structure (Up to Today)

```
backend-starter/
├── app/
│   └── main.py          # App factory, loads env and initializes FastAPI
├── .env.example         # Configuration contract (committed)
├── .env                # Local environment values (gitignored)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**Status:**
Environment-based configuration is correctly introduced.
The project is ready to move to centralized, type-safe settings in the next step.
