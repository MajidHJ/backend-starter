Below is a **concise, bullet-point daily report for Day 10**, aligned with `day_xx.md`, today’s discussions, and the actual work you did.
No extra commentary, no fluff.

## Day 10 – Daily Learning Report

### Goals for Today

* Introduce a **proper configuration system** for the application.
* Separate **environment-specific values** from application code.
* Move the project one step closer to a **production-ready backend structure**.
* Establish a clean boundary between **bootstrap code** and business logic.

---

### What I Learned Today

#### Configuration & Environment Management

* Understood the role of **Pydantic Settings (v2)** as a typed, validated configuration layer.
* Learned that `.env` files are **value sources**, not configuration definitions.
* Learned why configuration requires:

  * defaults (for safety and testability)
  * type safety (to avoid environment-related bugs)
  * a single, centralized reader.

#### Pydantic v2 Specifics

* Learned that `pydantic-settings` is a **separate package** in Pydantic v2.
* Understood why `model_config = SettingsConfigDict(...)` is required instead of `class Config`.
* Learned how environment variables override class defaults in a predictable order.

#### Naming & Conventions

* Learned that:

  * `app_name` (Python) correctly maps to `APP_NAME` (environment variable).
  * Case differences are intentional and standard.
* Clarified that single vs double quotes have no technical difference, but **consistency and tooling (formatters)** matter.

#### Application Bootstrap

* Understood the concept of **bootstrap** as:

  * configuration loading
  * logging setup (basic)
  * application creation
* Learned why `create_app()` (App Factory pattern) is important for future testing and scalability.

#### Logging Basics

* Identified incorrect usage of `logging.basicConfig`.
* Learned the difference between:

  * configuring logging
  * retrieving a logger instance with `getLogger`.

```

* `settings.py`

  * Defines configuration schema and defaults.
  * Loads environment variables from `.env` in development.
  * Acts as the **single source of configuration access**.

* `main.py`

  * Creates the FastAPI application via `create_app()`.
  * Consumes configuration from `settings`.
  * Contains only bootstrap logic and minimal routing.

---

### Current Project State

* Configuration is centralized, typed, and environment-aware.
* The application behavior (name, debug mode) is **config-driven**, not hardcoded.
* The project is now structurally ready for:

  * advanced logging
  * dependency injection
  * database wiring
  * test setup
