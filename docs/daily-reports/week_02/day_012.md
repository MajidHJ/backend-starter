### 📘 Day 12 — Debug Mode & Environment Awareness

#### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Understand what **debug mode** actually means in a backend context
* Make application behavior **environment-aware**
* Ensure configuration is not just loaded, but **observable at runtime**
* Prepare the codebase mentally and structurally for production vs development separation

---

#### 🧠 What I Learned Today

* Debug mode is **runtime context**, not just verbose output
* Configuration has value only if it **affects behavior** or is observable
* `Settings` must be the **single source of truth** for environment data
* Logging today is **intentional and minimal**, not the final logging system
* Premature “production-grade” logging leads to architectural debt
* Environment awareness is a prerequisite for:

  * proper logging
  * error handling
  * Docker and CI later in the roadmap

---

#### 🗂 Project Structure (Current)

* `app/main.py`

  * App factory pattern
  * Application startup aware of settings
* `app/settings.py`

  * Centralized, type-safe configuration using Pydantic Settings
  * Responsible for reading environment variables
* `.env.example`

  * Documents required environment variables
* `README.md`

  * Project goal and basic structure
* `.gitignore`

  * Proper exclusion of environment and cache files

Status: Application behavior now reflects its execution environment and is ready for structured logging and dependency work in the next stage.
