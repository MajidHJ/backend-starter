لهف## 📘 Day 8 — App Factory Introduction

### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Understand why a global `FastAPI()` instance is problematic
* Learn the App Factory pattern
* Perform a minimal, intentional refactor without changing behavior

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

* Why creating a global `FastAPI()` instance limits scalability and testability
* The difference between:

  * import time
  * application creation time
  * request/runtime execution
* How the App Factory pattern improves:

  * separation of concerns
  * future configurability
  * test readiness
* That architectural decisions matter before complexity appears
