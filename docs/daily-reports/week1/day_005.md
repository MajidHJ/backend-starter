# 📘 Day 5 — pathlib & Project Mindset

## 🎯 Goals for Today

- Understand why `pathlib` is preferred over `os.path`
- Learn how to work with absolute vs relative paths
- Build a growth-aware mindset for the project structure
- Think about future project scaling without adding premature code

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `__file__` points to the current file location, not the working directory
- `Path(__file__).resolve()` provides a stable, absolute path
- `.parent` returns the directory containing the file
- Path objects are safer and more readable than string-based paths
- Path handling decisions impact Docker, CI, and production environments
- Not adding code can be a deliberate and correct architectural decision
```
