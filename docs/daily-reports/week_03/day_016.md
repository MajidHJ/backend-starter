### 📘 Daily Report — Day 16

#### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Connect logging setup to the FastAPI App Factory
* Ensure logging is configured at runtime, not import-time
* Validate logging behavior via environment variables
* Clean up project hygiene issues (encoding, package init)

---

#### 🧠 What I Learned

* Logging configuration (`basicConfig`) must be executed once and in a controlled runtime point (App Factory), not during module import.
* Importing `logging` and creating module-level loggers with `getLogger(__name__)` is safe and side-effect free.
* Clear separation between **definition** (module scope) and **execution** (App Factory) is critical for scalable architecture.
* Encoding issues (UTF-16 vs UTF-8) can originate from the shell, not Python, and can break cross-platform compatibility.
* App Factory is the composition root where application-wide dependencies (settings, logging) must be wired together.

#### 🗂️ Project Structure (Current)

* `app/main.py` — App Factory, logging setup integration
* `app/settings.py` — Centralized configuration using Pydantic Settings
* `app/logging.py` — Single logging setup function (no side effects on import)
* `app/__init__.py` — Package initialization
* `.env` / `.env.example` — Environment-based configuration
* `.gitignore`
* `requirements.txt` — UTF-8 encoded, generated from virtual environment

**Status:** Day 16 completed. Project is aligned with Week 3 objectives and ready for lifespan events.
