**Day 15 – Daily Report**

### Goals

* Establish a centralized logging setup for the application
* Understand how Python logging works at a global/process level
* Prepare the project for production-oriented observability
* Keep logging concerns isolated from application and business logic

---

### What I Learned

* Python logging is intentionally designed as a **global state**, not a dependency to be injected everywhere.
* `setup_logging` is an initialization concern and must be called explicitly during application startup.
* `logging.getLogger(__name__)` maps logger names directly to the module path, enabling hierarchical and scalable logging.
* Log format placeholders like `%(name)s`, `%(levelname)s`, and `%(message)s` are fixed attributes of `LogRecord`, not arbitrary variables.
* Logging levels control which logs pass through, not the identity of the log itself.
* Centralized configuration prevents duplicated logs, unpredictable behavior, and polluted function signatures.
* Logging should be configured **once**, early in the app lifecycle, before handling any requests.

### Current Status

* Centralized logging setup is implemented.
* Logging is not yet wired into the app factory (planned for Day 16).
* Project structure remains simple and intentionally avoids premature architectural layers.
* Ready to integrate logging into the FastAPI startup flow next.
