### 📘 Daily Report — Day 18 (Week 3)

---

## 🎯 Goals for Today

* Understand Dependency Injection (DI) in FastAPI
* Build a correct mental model of `Depends`
* Clarify the difference between IoC and DI
* Apply DI in the project in a minimal, correct way

---

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

* `Depends` is a marker that tells FastAPI to **provide a value**, not execute a function immediately
* Dependency functions are executed **per request**, not at import time
* Using default parameters like `x=get_x()` breaks lifecycle, testability, and control
* Dependency Injection is a **technique**, while Inversion of Control is a **design principle**
* IoC means the code declares *what it needs*, not *how it is built*
* `Depends` is FastAPI’s DI mechanism that implements IoC at runtime
* Dependencies in different modules are connected via normal Python imports + FastAPI inspection
* Route handlers are consumers; they must not construct settings, DB sessions, or services

## 📁 Project Structure (Current)

```text
app/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py          # FastAPI app, routes, dependency consumption
├── settings.py      # Pydantic Settings (config)
├── logging.py       # Central logging setup
├── deps.py          # Dependency providers (DI entry point)
```

---

## ✅ Status Check

* Dependency Injection conceptually understood
* No hardcoded construction inside routes
* Project is ready for connecting real dependencies (settings, DB) in next days
