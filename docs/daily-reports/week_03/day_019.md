### 📘 Day 19 — Dependency Injection with Settings

#### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Make Dependency Injection meaningful by connecting it to real configuration
* Remove remaining hardcoded access to application settings
* Establish a clean pattern for future dependencies (DB, auth, etc.)

---

#### 🧠 What I Learned Today

* Dependency Injection is not about avoiding singletons, but about **controlling access and coupling**
* Importing shared objects directly is a form of **architectural hardcoding**
* A dependency provider (`get_settings`) acts as a **boundary**, even if it returns a singleton
* `create_app` is a **bootstrap/composition root**, so direct access to settings there is acceptable
* Route-level dependencies must declare *what they need*, not *where it comes from*
* Proper type hints on dependencies are essential for correctness and IDE support
* `deps.py` should expose **providers only**, not core types or models

#### 🧱 Project Structure (Current)

```
app/
├── main.py          # App factory, lifespan, route wiring
├── settings.py      # Pydantic Settings definition + singleton instance
├── logging.py       # Centralized logging setup
├── deps.py          # Dependency providers (e.g. get_settings)
```

---

#### ✅ Current State

* Configuration is centralized and type-safe
* Routes depend on abstractions, not globals
* The project is ready to accept more complex dependencies (DB session, request context) without refactoring
