## 🎯 Goals for Today

* Understand the purpose of request tracing in backend systems
* Learn why `request_id` is a core part of observability
* Clarify the role of Domain vs other layers
* Strengthen architectural thinking beyond writing code

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

* `request_id` exists to distinguish concurrent requests whose logs are interleaved
* Without `request_id`, logs in production are hard to debug and unreliable
* Observability means the system can explain its own behavior through logs and context
* `request_id` is **execution context**, not business data
* Domain layer represents pure business rules, independent of HTTP, DB, or frameworks
* Clear separation of API, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure prevents architectural decay

## 🏗️ Project Structure (Current)

* `app/main.py` — App factory and lifespan management
* `app/settings.py` — Centralized, type-safe configuration
* `app/logging.py` — Central logging setup
* `app/deps.py` — Dependency injection entry point
