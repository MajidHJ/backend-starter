## Day 37 Report

### Goals

* Introduce dedicated **User schemas (DTOs)** for request and response handling
* Separate HTTP contracts from internal data representation
* Prepare the project for real CRUD endpoints (starting Day 39)
* Establish schema-first discipline before expanding router logic

---

### What I Learned

* The difference between **Request Schema** and **Response Schema** and why they must not be merged
* Why `UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`, and `UserResponse` must be separate models
* How `EmailStr` and `Field(min_length, max_length)` enforce validation automatically
* Why validation belongs in Pydantic schemas instead of inside route logic
* The risk of data leakage when returning raw dicts
* The architectural importance of defining contracts *before* writing CRUD logic
* That schemas become truly active in Day 39 when used as `request body` and `response_model` in routes

### Project Structure (Up to Today)

```
app/
│
├── main.py
├── core/
│   └── config.py
│
├── api/
│   └── v1/
│       ├── router.py
│       └── users.py   (router skeleton only)
│
├── schemas/
│   ├── common.py
│   └── user.py        (UserCreate, UserUpdate, UserResponse)
│
└── ...
```

* `schemas/common.py` → generic response examples (previous days)
* `schemas/user.py` → dedicated User DTOs (introduced today)
* `api/v1/users.py` → router exists but CRUD not yet implemented
* No database yet (in-memory logic coming next)

---

**Status:**
Project is structurally ready to attach real CRUD endpoints using strict request/response contracts starting next session.
