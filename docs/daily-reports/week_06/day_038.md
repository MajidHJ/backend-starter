## 📘 Day 38 — Users Router (Skeleton)

### 🎯 Goals for Today

* Create a dedicated **router for the `users` resource**
* Connect the `users` router to **API v1**
* Establish proper routing structure before implementing endpoints
* Keep the router intentionally empty (no CRUD yet)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

* Each **resource must have its own router** (users ≠ health)
* `APIRouter` acts as a modular unit with:

  * `prefix`
  * `tags`
  * `include_router`
* API versioning (`/v1`) is structural, not cosmetic — it protects future backward compatibility
* Route files should contain only routing concerns — no business logic yet
* `/v1/users` should exist even if it has no endpoints yet (structure before behavior)
* From previous days:

  * API contract was designed before implementation (Day 36)
  * Schemas (`UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`, `UserResponse`) were separated and prepared for routes (Day 37)

### 🏗 Project Structure (Current)

```
app/
├── main.py
├── api/
│   ├── router.py
│   ├── health.py
│   └── v1/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── router.py
│       └── users.py
├── schemas/
│   ├── user.py
│   └── common.py
```

* `main.py` contains no endpoints (clean entry point)
* `api/router.py` is the central router
* `api/v1/router.py` defines version prefix `/v1`
* `api/v1/users.py` contains the users router skeleton
* Schemas are separated from routes

---

**State at the end of Day 38:**

* `/v1/users` is structurally registered
* No endpoint logic implemented yet
* Architecture is clean and ready for CRUD implementation next day
