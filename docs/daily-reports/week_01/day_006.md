# 📘 Day 6 — Logging Basics (Conceptual)

## 🎯 Goals for Today
- Understand why logging is essential in backend systems
- Learn the difference between print statements and logging
- Get familiar with basic logging levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Introduce logging conceptually into the project

---

## 🧠 What I Learned (Week 1 – Day 6)
- Logging is about observing system behavior, not debugging with print
- Log level represents the importance of a message, not whether it is shown
- The logging system filters messages based on configured level
- INFO logs describe normal application flow
- Logging decisions are part of system design, not temporary output
